UNION removes duplicate records (where all columns in the results are the same), 
UNION ALL does not.

Union example:

SELECT 'foo' AS bar UNION SELECT 'foo' AS bar

Result:

+-----+
| bar |
+-----+
| foo |
+-----+


UNION ALL example:

SELECT 'foo' AS bar UNION ALL SELECT 'foo' AS bar
Result:

+-----+
| bar |
+-----+
| foo |
| foo |
+-----+
